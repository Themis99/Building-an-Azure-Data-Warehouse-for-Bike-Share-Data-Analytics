## Building-an-Azure-Data-Warehouse-for-Bike-Share-Data-Analytics

Divvy is a bike sharing program in Chicago, Illinois USA that allows riders to purchase a pass at a kiosk or use a mobile application to unlock a bike at stations around the city and use the bike for a specified amount of time. The bikes can be returned to the same station or to another station. The City of Chicago makes the anonymized bike trip data publicly available for projects like this where we can analyze the data. due to the anonymity of the data, fake rider and account profiles, along with fake payment data, have been created to accompany the data from Divvy

The goal in this project is to develop a data warehouse solution using Azure Synapse Analytics and more specifically to:

- Design a star schema based on the business outcomes listed below;
- Import the data into Synapse;
- Transform the data into the star schema;
- View the reports from Analytics.
